# EasyGolfStats
Simple App which stores golf shots and their quality to create statistics.

## About
As a part of an analytic system (see below) EasyGolfStats is an Android based app that helps you controlling the progress of your golf game.

This is not about scientific accuracy, but about your personal assessment. The basis is your goals and your individual possibilities.
The analysis is based on a simple evaluation of your strokes in 'good', 'neutral', 'bad'.
Important is to get an easy and quick to use app which doesn't hinder the training. So it is created only to store some less hit informations 
* club
* kind of hit (e.g. bunker or pitch)
* quality

## Analytic System
As mentioned before, the app is only one component of an overall solution. 
After a training session the App transfers the hit data to a web server. The web server prepares the data for later analysis which is presented to the user.
This comprehensive solution is currently under development. 

## Manual Analysis
Until the whole solution is available the data can be analysed manually.
To do this, the files can be copied from the smartphone to a PC for further processing (e.g. with a spreadsheet).
You find the data files on the smartphone in the internal storage under /Android/data/de.easygolfstats/files/data/
